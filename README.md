Generic Class and Data Type

This Java program showcases the use of generic methods to find the minimum element in arrays of different data types. The code defines a generic method min that can be applied to arrays of any type that extends the Comparable interface.
Class Overview
GenericClassAndDataType Class

The GenericClassAndDataType class contains the main method where instances of arrays for different data types are created. The min method is then called for each array, and the minimum element is printed to the console.

Usage

Run the GenericClassAndDataType class.
The program creates arrays of strings, integers, and doubles.
The min method is called for each array, and the minimum element is printed to the console.

Note

The <E extends Comparable<E>> syntax in the min method indicates that the generic type E must extend the Comparable interface. This ensures that the elements in the array can be compared.

The generic method allows the same logic to be applied to different types without the need for code duplication.

Feel free to experiment with other data types or add more arrays to see the flexibility and reusability of the generic method.

This program demonstrates the power of generics in creating reusable and type-safe code for common operations across different data types.
